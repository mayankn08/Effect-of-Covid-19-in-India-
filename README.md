### Dashboard Link : https://app.powerbi.com/groups/me/reports/50c4e58d-e170-4e82-bb51-1e85630c6343/ReportSection?experience=power-bi

## Objective 

To analyze and visualize the impact of COVID-19 across different states and union territories (UTs) in India, providing insights into the spread, severity, and outcomes of the pandemic. This analysis aims to inform public health strategies, resource allocation, and policy-making to better manage current and future health crises.

## Scope

The project will involve collecting, processing, and visualizing data related to COVID-19 cases, recoveries, deaths, and population statistics across various Indian states and UTs. The goal is to identify trends, correlations, and disparities in the impact of the pandemic.

   Sum of Total Population : 1.43bn

   Sum of Total Cases      : 45M

   Sum of Active Cases     : 1812

   Sum of Active Ratio     : 0.18

   Sum of Discharged       : 44M

   Sum of Discharge Ratio  : 3.56K

   Sum of Total Deaths     : 532K

   Sum of Death Ratio      : 39.52

#### [2] State/UT with the Highest and Lowest Total Cases:
Maharashtra had the highest number of total COVID-19 cases with 8,171,048 cases.

Andaman and Nicobar Islands had the lowest number of total COVID-19 cases with 10,766 cases.

The total cases in Maharashtra were 75,796.79% higher than in Andaman and Nicobar Islands.

#### [3] Proportion of Total Cases:
Maharashtra accounted for 18.16% of the total COVID-19 cases across India.

#### [4] Range of Total Cases Across States/UTs:
The total cases across all 36 States/UTs ranged from 10,766 (Andaman and Nicobar Islands) to 8,171,048 (Maharashtra).

#### [5] Largest Divergence Between Population and Total Cases:

Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu had the largest divergence, with the population being 231,490,986 higher than the total number of cases.

#### [6] Total Cases in Punjab:

Punjab had a total of 793,644 COVID-19 cases.

#### [7] Correlation Between Population and Total Cases:

There is a negative correlation between the sum of the population and the total number of COVID-19 cases. This implies that a higher population does not necessarily mean a higher number of cases.

#### [8] Specific Divergence in Punjab:

In Punjab, the population was 33,905,232 higher than the total number of COVID-19 cases.

## Summary:
Maharashtra is the most impacted state in terms of the number of COVID-19 cases, contributing a significant portion of the total cases in India.
There is a significant disparity in the number of cases across different States/UTs, with some regions having a very high number of cases and others having relatively low numbers.
The negative correlation between population and total cases suggests that the spread of COVID-19 was not uniform and might have been influenced by other factors like density, healthcare infrastructure, and measures taken by the states.
The largest divergences between population and total cases in states like Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu and Punjab highlight that populous regions did not always correspond to the highest number of cases, indicating the complexity of COVID-19 spread and impact.
